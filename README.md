# monitoring-alerting-stack
This project demonstrates how to monitor a Linux server using Prometheus, Node Exporter, and Grafana, and how to configure Alertmanager for real-time anomaly detection and alerts.

Objectives

Collect real-time server metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).

Visualize data in Grafana dashboards.

Set up custom alert rules in Prometheus.

Trigger and receive alerts via Alertmanager (email).

Environment

Ubuntu Server (Monitored host)

Prometheus

Node Exporter

Grafana

Alertmanager

Setup Instructions

See setup/ for detailed installation and configuration steps for Prometheus, Node Exporter, Grafana, and Alertmanager.

Simulated Alerts

See tests/ for steps to simulate high CPU usage and trigger alerts.

Observations

See screenshots/ and logs/ for Grafana dashboard outputs, alert emails, and system metrics.
