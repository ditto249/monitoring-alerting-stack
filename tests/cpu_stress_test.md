# CPU Stress Test 

This test validates that the monitoring and alerting stack detects and alerts on high CPU usage.

## Steps

### 1. Run a CPU Stress Test
On the **web server VM** (where Node Exporter is installed), run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y stress
```

Run 4 workers stressing CPU for 60 seconds
stress --cpu 4 --timeout 60

### 2. Verify in Prometheus
On the Prometheus VM:
-Open Prometheus at http://localhost:9090/alerts.
Run the query:
-avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[2m]))
You should see values increase above 0.8 during the stress test.

### 3. Check Grafana
-Open Grafana (default: http://<prometheus-vm-ip>:3000).
-Go to the CPU Dashboard.
-Look for a visible spike during the stress test period.

### 4. Confirm Alerting
Prometheus should mark the HighCPUUsage alert as Pending â†’ Firing.
Alertmanager should receive the alert.
If email is configured, you should receive an alert with a subject like:
- [FIRING:1] HighCPUUsage (instance web-server:9100)

### Expected results

AlertManager has email to send:

Email sent:

### Notes
If the alert does not fire:
- Ensure Node Exporter is running on the web server (systemctl status node_exporter).
- Confirm Prometheus is scraping Node Exporter (http://<web-server-ip>:9100/metrics).
- Check that the alert rule in prometheus.yml matches the threshold.
